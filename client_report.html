            <h1>Client Report</h1>
                <p>I decided the content I wanted for my page by thinking about what I liked most. Star wars, and I found some images that I thought would look cool in the website. And for my two pages they are my favorite star wars movies and for those it was pretty simple to find an image.</p>
                <p>I communicated with my lead developer through email. There was no trouble there as he and I always answered each other, but we rarely had trouble or questions.</p>
                <p>My lead developer met my expectations if not exceeded them too.</p>
                <p>What I would do differently is to make sure everything in my site plan is detailed and clear to understand with no confusion if someone ever had a question makiing it.</p>
            <h1>Lead Developer Report</h1>
                <p>I emailed my team and let them know I would get the html done. And we did not really communicate much, which is on me for not emailing as often, but it seemed that the site went smoothly and when I added the html and css my junior developers were able to add it very well</p>
                <p>I communicated with my client through email and there was no issues he answered any question I had.</p>
                <p>Pushing my clients site went well there was no trouble, I always checked to see if someone did something before I changed anything.</p>
                <p>My experience managing github went well I enjoyed learning how to have all my files and project on one html page and have all my work in one place.</p>
            <h1>junior Developer Report</h1>
                <p>I was not able to really contact either of my team leads. One did not show up the entire time and the other was there a few times and did not reply.</p>
                <p>I do not know what was expected of me, I know for the one who barely showed up they got a "site plan" but it was 4 boxes with a few words and nothing else. I asked for it and got no reply.</p>
                <p>I was not able to contribute to any sites.</p>
                <p>I did not run into any problems with github</p>
            <h1>General experience</h1>
                <p>The most challenging part was trying to follow my clients site plan and get everything that he wanted on there. Some of the instructions were confusuing so I tried my best.</p>
                <p>What I enjoyed most was as the lead developer watching the site come along as the junior developers add there sites and they match well to the homoe page.</p>
                <p>What I would do differently is just make sure to better communicate all around, as a client and lead developer.</p>
                <p>I do feel a little more confident working on projects because I was able to make a project work when I did not have the idea of making it. So being able to create someone elses vision was cool to see that I know how to do that.</p>
