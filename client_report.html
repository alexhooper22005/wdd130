            Client Report
                I decided the content I wanted for my page by thinking about what I liked most. Star wars, and I found some images that I thought would look cool in the website. And for my two pages they are my favorite star wars movies and for those it was pretty simple to find an image.
                I communicated with my lead developer through email. There was no trouble there as he and I always answered each other, but we rarely had trouble or questions.
                My lead developer met my expectations if not exceeded them too.
                What I would do differently is to make sure everything in my site plan is detailed and clear to understand with no confusion if someone ever had a question makiing it.

                I emailed my team and let them know I would get the html done. And we did not really communicate much, which is on me for not emailing as often, but it seemed that the site went smoothly and when I added the html and css my junior developers were able to add it very well
                I communicated with my client through email and there was no issues he answered any question I had.
                Pushing my clients site went well there was no trouble, I always checked to see if someone did something before I changed anything.
                My experience managing github went well I enjoyed learning how to have all my files and project on one html page and have all my work in one place.
